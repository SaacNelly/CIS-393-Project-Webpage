Index is my main page.
Also, I couldn't upload the node packages to github. I assume that was expected?
If not, just install node, mysql, express, and I think thats it. Just the stuff we used in class.
Also not sure if I was supposed to host the website. I read that github.io wont work with database stuff so I didn't.

I wrote this message on my about page as well, but I'll paste it here to avoid any confusion:

This website did not end up being nearly close to what I had hoped. 
Because my car broke last weekend, I lost nearly two full days that I had planned to use to make the website that I originally wanted. 
By the time I was able to continue work on my project, I realized I wouldnâ€™t have time to complete what I wanted to do, so I scrapped the entire thing. 
I decided my best option would be to make a barebones webpage that fulfills the requirements listed on the Project Part 2 description. 
This means I just set up the database stuff. 
If I could have back the days lost from vehicular failure, I would likely have been able to make a half decent website. 
I apologize for making such a lackluster webpage.
