            <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p>This website did not end up being nearly close to what I had hoped. Because my car broke last weekend, I lost nearly two full days that I had planned to use to make the website that I originally wanted. By the time I was able to continue work on my project, I realized I wouldnâ€™t have time to complete what I wanted to do, so I scrapped the entire thing. I decided my best option would be to make a barebones webpage that fulfills the requirements listed on the Project Part 2 description. This means I just set up the database stuff. If I could have back the days lost from vehicular failure, I would likely have been able to make a half decent website. I apologize for making such a lackluster webpage.</p>
